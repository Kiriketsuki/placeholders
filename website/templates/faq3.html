            <article class="article-detail"><p>As of August 30<sup>th</sup> 2010, HDB introduced new measures in their bid to ensure public housing remain within reach for Singaporean first time home buyers.</p><p>The measures include:</p><p><b>1. Stamp Duty</b><br />- Levy imposed on those selling residential properties within three years, up from one year</p><p><b>2. Curbs on buyers with outstanding home loans</b><br />- Have to pay 10 per cent in cash, up from 5 per cent</p><p>- Can borrow only up to 70 per cent of a property's value, down from 80 per cent</p><p><b>3. Concurrent ownership of HDB flat and private residential property</b><br />- HDB owner not allowed to own private property during 5-year minimum occupation period, up from 3 years</p><p>- Private property owners who buy a non-subsidized HDB flat must sell their private property within six months from date of flat purchase</p><p><b>4. Allow households earning between $8000 and $10000 to buy new DBSS flats</b><br />Widened options to allow households earning between $8000 and $10000 to buy new DBSS flats with a $30000 CPF Housing Grant, similar to the purchase of ECs.</p><p><b>5. Increase supply of new flats, DBSS flats and Ecs</b><br />More than 16000 new flats will be offered in 2010 and if demand remains strong, HDB will launch up to 22000 new flats in 2011.</p><p><b>6. Shorten the completion time of BTO flats</b><br />BTO processes will be streamlined to allow flat buyers of projects launched in mid-2011 to collect keys to their new homes within 2.5 years instead of the current 3 years.</p><p><b>7. Increase the Minimum Occupation Period for *non-subsidized flats to 5 years</b><br />HDB flats are meant for long-term owner-occupation. The increase in MOP will dampen demand for those who are not in urgent need of housing.</p><p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note:</span></b> *Resale flat bought without CPF housing grant. The MOP will be computed from the effective date of purchase of the non-subsidized flats.</p><p>For further enquiries the pulic can contact HDB at the following numbers:</p><ul><li>Sales/Resale Customer Service Line: 1800 8663 066</li><li>Branch Office Service Line: 1800 2255 432</li></ul></article>
